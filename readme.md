## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Data Pipeline

This project leverages a powerful stack of data science and web development tools.

-   **Backend & Modeling:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
-   **Frontend:** Streamlit
-   **Data Source:** `laptops.csv` (A dataset containing over 1300 laptop records)

The data pipeline involves several key steps to ensure model accuracy:
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and corrected data types for `Ram` and `Weight`.
2.  **Feature Engineering:**
    -   Calculated **Pixels Per Inch (PPI)** from screen resolution and size for a more informative display feature.
    -   Extracted **CPU, GPU, and OS brands** from complex text fields into clean, categorical features.
    -   Transformed the `Memory` column into separate numerical features for `HDD` and `SSD`.
3.  **Data Transformation:** Applied a **log transformation** to the target variable (`Price`) to normalize its distribution, improving model performance. The final prediction is exponentiated to return the actual price.
